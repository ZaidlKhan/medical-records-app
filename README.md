# Electronic Medical Record Application

## An application with clinical uses

What will this application do:
- Be able to retrieve and view patient medical records
- Be able to store patient data
- Be able to send prescriptions to pharmacies across UBC
- Be able to send patients to specialists

<p>
The electronic medical records app will allow 
doctors and medical staff to easily access and 
update patient information, send prescriptions to 
pharmacies, and book appointments with specialists
in a secure and efficient manner. This project
is of interest because many people in my life who are 
work in healthcare have complained about the inefficiency of
current medical record systems, and I believe that
this app could provide a valuable solution to 
these issues.
